u-boot-nezha (2021.09+git20211008.62392d3-0ubuntu1) jammy; urgency=medium

  * Provide U-Boot for Nezha D1 board (LP: #1954772)
    Currently the board is not upstreamed and there are siginificant
    differences to upstream U-Boot. Therefore temporarily use a
    separate source package (git tag: nezha-u-boot-20210911).
